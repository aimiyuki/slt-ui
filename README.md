# SLT

This is a web UI for the prototype built for my bachelor thesis: [Same Language Translator
—Reformulating Complex Expressions into Plain Words—](https://github.com/aimiyuki/slt-prototype/releases/download/v1.0/bachelor-thesis.pdf)

It takes as input a complex Japanese sentence and transforms it into a simpler one.
A demo is available at the following URL:

## Setup

This requires [slt-prototype](https://github.com/aimiyuki/slt-prototype) to be running locally.

```
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
